# My tic-tac-toe Program

Simple tic-tac-toe program that plays ttt with a client over TCP. The server communicates with hosts asynchronously, that is, the server can play multple games with multiple clients.

Future plans for this program includes creating a QT UI and binding it to the python code.
To run the program, execute the following in two separate terminals:

```python3 server/ttts.py```

```python3 client/tttc_driver.py```
